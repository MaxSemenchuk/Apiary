# Grant Proposal Draft

## Aragon Nest Proposal: Apiary app – Responsible Crowdfunding through the Curation Market

### Abstract

Apiary is a platform for emergent organization built on Aragon. Contributors stake tokens into organizations on the Apiary platform using a bonding curve. Funds held in the bonding curve's reserve pool are released over time into a discretionary pool that the Aragon DAO can use to reward contributors. Splitting funds into reserve and discretionary pools provides smart-contract enforced accountability between project contributors and patrons throughout the lifecycle of a project while simultaneously ensuring sufficient liquidity to support the emergence of a long-tail of micro-organizations.

### Deliverables

Aragon app\(s\) deployed on the testnet and published to the APM, with the interface to the stakeholders

### Grant size

Funding: Up to $100k in ETH, split into chunks paid out over achieved deliverables.   
Success reward: Up to $50k in ANT, given out when all deliverables are ready.

### Development timeline

The development timeline will be the following one in regards to each deliverable:

| Release | Estimated time | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.1 | 1 month | Crowdfunding app to create fundraising campaigns through the voting process |
| 0.2 | 1 month | Tap mechanics + Instant Liquidation |
| 0.3 | 1 month | Market Maker + Bonding Curve mechanics |
| 0.4 | 1 month | Advanced terms of crowdfunding |
| 0.5 | 1 month | Curation market mechanics |
| 1.0 | 2-3 months | Bug Bounty campaign / auditing and polishing |

### Development Approach

Agile & Scrum with 2 weeks sprints. Each sprint will finish with the publicly available demo or report. The releases would undergo some kind of security audit with an open bounty campaign in the end for the app on the testnet.
