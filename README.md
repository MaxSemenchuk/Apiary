# Apiary Project Proposal Draft

Aragon Crowdfunding App, to enable more responsible crowdfunding with DAOs

**Problems**

* Costly ICO infrastructure
* Misaligned incentives between founders and investors
* Threat of scam

**Solution**

* Motivate funds and individuals to prefer DAO structures for funding
* Allow easy creation of the company and launch of the crowdsale \(maybe start with lower amounts like $10-100k, not millions\)
* Allow setting up the transparent crowdsale terms and lockups

**Features**

* Crowdsale stages setup
* Token freeze
* Tap on spendings
* Milestone-Based Lockups
