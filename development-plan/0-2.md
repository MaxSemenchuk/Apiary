# 0.2 Tap + Instant Liquidation

## Restricted token minting

Initial token minting will be restricted to the Apiary Application.

## Tap

Funds which have moved from the bonding curve’s reserve pool to the organization’s discretionary pool can be directly governed by the organization \(see section 3 for more details\). These funds can be used to reward contributors to the project.

## Instant Liquidation

In some cases a majority of the token holders will all want to sell at once, this can occur if the project encounters an issue that makes it clear that it should not continue or if key members of the team decide to leave the project. Rather than rushing to exit via the bonding curve, the community can vote to liquidate the reserve pool returning funds to the bonding curves token holders on a pro-rata basis.
