Team and roadmap

### Proposal

Apiary is a platform for emergent organization built on Aragon. Contributors stake tokens into organizations on the Apiary platform using a bonding curve. Funds held in the bonding curve's reserve pool are released over time into a discretionary pool that the Aragon DAO can use to reward contributors. Splitting funds into reserve and discretionary pools provides smart-contract enforced accountability between project contributors and patrons throughout the lifecycle of a project while simultaneously ensuring sufficient liquidity to support the emergence of a long-tail of micro-organizations.

We are a driven team willing to take on this project and work on it for the 6-12 months.
