Griff Green — Researcher & Developer  


Griff started his career as a blockchain revolutionary in 2013, when he began educating on Bitcoin, coordinating meetups, and creating online Ethereum educational content. After serving as the Community Organizer on Slock.it, he co-founded the White Hat Group in 2016, which secured the at-risk funds \(~$100 million USD at the time\) from the DAO hack and also helped secure $210 million dollars worth of crypto assets in the Parity Multisig Hack one year later. In 2016, Griff founded Giveth to use smart contracts to radically empower individuals and communities to affect real change.
